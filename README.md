An artificial neural network (ANN) is a machine learning model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain's interconnected network of neurons. It consists of interconnected nodes called artificial neurons, organized into layers. Information flows through the network, with each neuron processing input signals and producing an output signal that influences other neurons in the network.

A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network consisting of multiple layers of neurons. The neurons in the MLP typically use nonlinear activation functions, allowing the network to learn complex patterns in data
